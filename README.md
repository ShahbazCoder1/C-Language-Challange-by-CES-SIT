## üéØ 30-Day Coding Challenge Overview

This repository contains solutions to a comprehensive 30-day C programming challenge. Each day focuses on a specific programming concept, helping learners progressively build their C programming skills.

### üìö Challenge Progress

| Day | Challenge Description | Source File | Concepts Covered |
|-----|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1   | Hello World | `hello.c` | Basic program structure |
| 2   | Variable Declaration and Initialization | `var_init.c` | Variables, data types |
| 3   | User Input and Output | `input_val.c` | I/O functions, user interaction |
| 4   | Arithmetic Operations | `math_sol.c` | Mathematical operations, operators |
| 5   | Conditional Statements (If-Else) | `conditional_stmt.c` | Decision making, control flow |
| 6   | Finding Largest Number | `largest.c` | Comparative logic, conditional statements |
| ... | More challenges to come | | |
