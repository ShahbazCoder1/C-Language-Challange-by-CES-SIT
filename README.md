# Coding Challenges

A collection of coding challenges and solutions in C.


## 30-Day Coding Challenge

This repository contains solutions to the 30-day coding challenge. Each day's challenge is solved in a separate C file.


### Challenges

| Day | Challenge | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Hello World | `hello.c` |
| 2   | Practice declaring and Initializing Variables | `var_init.c` |
| 3   | Write a program to take input from the user and print the values | `input_val.c` |
| 4   | Perform arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus) | `math_sol.c` |
| 5   | Practice using IF-ELSE for simple decision making | `conditional_stmt.c` |
| 6   | Write a program to find the Largest of Two Numbers using IF-ELSE | `largest.c` |
